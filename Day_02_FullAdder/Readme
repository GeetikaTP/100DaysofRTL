Full Adder

Full adder is used to add three bits.
Eight output combinations are possible.
The input to the adder are A,B,Cin.
The Outputs are Sum and Carry.
Sum = A XOR B XOR C;
Carry = AB + BC + AC;

Can be implemented using 2 XOR + 2 AND+ 1 OR
or it can be implemented using 9 NAND/ 9 NOR Universal gates.
